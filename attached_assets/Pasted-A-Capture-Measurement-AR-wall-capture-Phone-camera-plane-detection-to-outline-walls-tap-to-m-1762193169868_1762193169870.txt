A. Capture & Measurement

AR wall capture: Phone camera + plane detection to outline walls; tap-to-mark doors/windows; calculates square footage and linear trim automatically.

Reference-object photogrammetry: Snap each wall with a standard object (sheet of paper, A4/Letter) auto-detected to infer scale; stitches a room model, computes surfaces + paint volumes.

Ceiling height inference: Estimation via door height heuristics + perspective (option to override).

Trim & baseboard classifier: CV model tags crown/baseboard/chair rail; separates finish type + linear footage.

Surface condition detection: AI flags patching, stains, cracking, orange-peel vs. smooth, recommending prep time and materials.

Color extraction from photo: Picks current wall color into a digital swatch; offers closest matches in major pro lines (Benjamin Moore, Sherwin-Williams, etc.).

Room set templates: “3-bed semi,” “single office,” “open-plan floor” presets with editable defaults for speed.

B. Visualization

AI recolor preview: Swap wall colors with edge-aware masks, preserve lighting/shadows; before-after slider; exportable to PDF for quotes.

Finish & sheen simulator: Matte/Eggshell/Satin/Gloss reflectance simulation to set expectations (reduces callbacks).

Accent wall planner: Suggests accent placements using rule-of-thirds and focal points detected in the room.

C. Quote Intelligence

Coverage engine: Computes gallons/liters by substrate + coat count; adjusts for primer needs and brand-specific coverage ranges.

Labor time model: Parametric estimator by surface area, cut-in complexity, height, masking needs, doors/casings count, and condition score.

Multi-option quoting: Good/Better/Best packages (e.g., Standard vs. Premium paint, 1-year vs. 3-year touch-up). One-tap accept per option.

Upsell recommender: AI suggests add-ons (feature walls, cabinet refinishing, ceiling refresh, caulking) based on captured context.

Margin guardrails: Warns when price drops below target gross margin; shows slider of price ↔ probability to win (based on historical close data).

Change-order engine: Mid-job scope changes produce clean addendums with e-sign + updated materials list.

D. Ops & Workflow

Instant BOM & shopping list: Auto-generates materials by brand/line; export to CSV/PDF; per-room labels; split by store aisle.

Vendor price sync: Store-specific price lists cached in Firestore; update via CSV upload; app recalculates quotes.

Crew scheduler + capacity check: Drag-and-drop calendar with capacity warnings (crew size, daylight, drying time).

On-site job pack: Print/share a packet with color codes, sheens, room maps, masking notes, substrate warnings, and site contact details.

Time & task tracker: Simple per-room checklist with start/stop timers; feeds back into estimator to improve accuracy over time.

E. Sales & Customer Experience

Instant web quote intake: Embeddable widget for homeowners; guides them to snap rooms and select finishes; pushes a draft quote to your dashboard.

Client portal: Approvals, color selections, schedule, payments, warranties; homeowners can comment on rooms (pin-drop notes).

E-sign + deposit: Stripe integration; configurable deposit %; auto-issues invoices and receipts.

Review & referral nudges: Post-completion flow with deep links to Google Business reviews; referral code generator.

F. Quality, Risk & Compliance

VOC & compliance checker: Flags products exceeding client or jurisdictional VOC limits; suggests alternatives.

Safety checklist & ladder plan: Auto-generates site safety list based on ceiling heights and exterior work; stores signed acknowledgment.

Weather guard (exteriors): Pulls local forecast; warns about temperature/humidity/precipitation windows; reschedule assistant.

G. Intelligence & Learning

Win-loss learning loop: Tracks accepted vs. rejected quotes; correlates to price, speed, option mix; suggests price bands per neighborhood profile.

Template A/B tests: Iterate on quote layout/emails/SMS; measure open, click, accept.

Cost drift alerts: Notifies when vendor prices or labor costs move enough to warrant template updates.
